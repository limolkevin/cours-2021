            <p>One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the
                little French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney.
                Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as
                possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.</p>
            <p>Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the
                rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”</p>
